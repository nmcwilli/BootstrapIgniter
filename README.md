# [BootstrapIgniter](http://github.com/nmcwilli/bootstrapigniter)

BootstrapIgniter is a lightweight combination of Bootstrap, CodeIgniter, Font Awesome and JQuery pre-configured with a fluid width layout. It is a great launching point for developing responsive websites or web applications and want to use the front end benefits of Bootstrap and the model-view-controller approach of CodeIgniter.
